--------------------------------

- add analytics method: calculate earth impedance from impedance profile using different algorithm: 
    - max of all values
    - 62 % distance to current probe: necessary input: distance to current probe
    - minimum gradient
    - minimum standard deviation
    - Z^-1 (1/x=0) variant

    - output a measurement item earth_impedance (default) or earth_resistance if argument earth_resistance is set 

- read earth measurements from images. focus on COMPANO disyplay output
    - 1m measurement = propective touch voltage
    - 1m ... X m = impedance profile
    - current = if range of currents +/- 20% use the mean of all curents as reference for a measurement item




- Earthing impedance, earthing current
Check that is only 1 earthing_impedance and earthing current per frequency within one measurement
